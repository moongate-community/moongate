## Overview

Moongate is a cutting-edge, ultra-high-performance Ultima Online server emulator built with .NET 9 and AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation. Designed specifically for the passionate UO community that still cherishes this legendary MMORPG, Moongate delivers exceptional performance and unprecedented customization capabilities through modern architecture and a powerful JavaScript scripting engine.

Our mission is simple: create the **most performant and customizable UO server** ever built, giving dedicated players and server administrators the tools they deserve.

## üß≠ State of the Art

**Codename**: *"It's not ModernUO with JS"*

> Moongate is not a clone of ModernUO, RunUO, ServUO or any other emulator ‚Äî and it doesn't aim to be. In fact, we owe a great deal of inspiration to these projects. Their legacy and technical achievements are invaluable, and this project wouldn‚Äôt exist without them. Thank you.

Moongate is a personal journey ‚Äî a way to study the internals of MMOs, experiment with high-performance .NET architecture, and explore advanced networking and scripting systems. It is **not** meant to replace existing servers or communities, but to learn, contribute, and share.

### ‚úÖ Milestone: *"It's not ModernUO with JS"*

The following features have been implemented in this phase:

- ‚ö° **Ultra-fast binary persistence** for game entities
- üë§ **Character creation and deletion**
- üåç **World segmentation into sectors** for spatial optimization
- üîê **Command system with account-level permissions**
- üéí **Item pickup and equipment handling**
- üß± **Initial implementation of Megaloc (location manager)**
- üß≥ **Backpack management**
- üßç **Paperdoll system**


## Overview

Moongate is a cutting-edge, ultra-high-performance Ultima Online server emulator built with .NET 9 and AOT (Ahead-of-Time)
compilation. Designed specifically for the passionate UO community that still cherishes this legendary MMORPG, Moongate
delivers exceptional performance and unprecedented customization capabilities through modern architecture and a powerful
JavaScript scripting engine.

Our mission is simple: create the **most performant and customizable UO server** ever built, giving dedicated players and
server administrators the tools they deserve.

## Vision & Philosophy

While Ultima Online may have a smaller player base today, those who still play deserve nothing less than perfection. Moongate
is built on these core principles:

- **Performance Above All** - Leveraging .NET 9 AOT for maximum speed and efficiency
- **JavaScript-Powered Customization** - Making server modification accessible to everyone
- **Modern Architecture** - Clean, maintainable code built for the future
- **Community-First** - Empowering server owners to create unique experiences
- **Legacy Respect** - Honoring classic UO while enhancing it with modern technology

## Key Features

### üöÄ Extreme Performance

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- Ultima Online Classic Client **version 7.x only** (officially supported)
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider for development

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moongate-community/moongate.git
   cd moongate
   ```

2. **Build the solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Configure the server**
   ```bash
   # Edit the configuration to set your UO client path
   nano moongate/moongate.json
   ```

4. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/Moongate.Server
   ```

### ‚ö° AOT Production Build

For maximum performance in production:

```bash
# Build with AOT compilation
./scripts/run_aot.sh

# Or manually:
dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -o dist -p:PublishAot=true -c Release src/Moongate.Server
./dist/Moongate.Server
```

### üê≥ Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t moongate-server .

# Run with volume mapping for configuration and data
docker run -d \
  -p 2593:2593 \
  -v ./moongate:/app/moongate \
  moongate-server
```

## Configuration

Moongate uses a simple JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "port": 2593,
    "logPackets": false
  },
  "webServer": {
    "port": 23853,
    "enabled": true
  },
  "name": "Moongate Shard",
  "ultimaOnlineDirectory": "~/uo/"
}
```

## JavaScript Scripting

### üéØ Powerful Scripting Engine

Moongate features a sophisticated JavaScript scripting system that makes customization accessible:

```javascript
// Auto-generated TypeScript definitions provide full intellisense
/// <reference path="index.d.ts" />

// Example: Custom spell implementation (future implementation)
class Fireball {
  constructor() {
    this.manaCost = 15;
    this.requiredSkill = 40;
  }

  cast(caster, target) {
    if (!this.checkMana(caster)) {
      logger.warn(`${caster.name} lacks mana for Fireball`);
      return false;
    }

    const damage = this.calculateDamage(caster);
    target.takeDamage(damage);

    logger.info(`${caster.name} cast Fireball on ${target.name} for ${damage} damage`);
    return true;
  }

  calculateDamage(caster) {
    const magery = caster.skills.magery;
    return Math.floor(10 + (magery / 10));
  }
}

// Register with the spell system
spells.register(new Fireball());
```

### üìö Available Script Modules

```bash
# Enable packet logging in config
"LogPackets": true

# View real-time packet flow
tail -f logs/network_packets_*.log
```
